#subheadline: "... because we need one!"

We aim to establish a curated, comprehensive list of open source tools for perfusion analysis. We feel that many researchers often struggle trying to find publicly available perfusion analysis tools, understand how different solutions compare in their capabilities, how robust they are, and what are their limitations.

We are working to compile an extensible list of open source perfusion solutions, accompanied by details related to the implementation approach, models implemented, specific license adopted, validation performed, etc, to inform users and developers
of perfusion applications.

You can help us make this list more complete and more comprehensive!

Please contact
us via the mailing list if:
* you know of an open source perfusion solution that is not listed below
* you have experience that you want to share about using any of the tools listed below
* you find any of the information inaccurate or incomplete, and can suggest improvements

**Stay tuned - coming up!**
