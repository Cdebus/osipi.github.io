If you are interested to participate the initiative, the best way to start is to join our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-source-initiative-for-perfusion-imaging).

We are very interested to learn about your experience with using perfusion tools, what are the most important roadblocks to successful translation and deployment of this technology, and how you can contribute to the effort.
