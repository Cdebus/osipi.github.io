title: "Consensus Recommendations for Reporting Perfusion Analysis Results"
#subheadline: "... because we need one!"
---

We are all used to seeing nutrition facts and list of ingredients on every product we buy in the supermarket. It is common sense that we need those to compare similar items from different manufacturers.

Alas, common sense is not common in many software tools implementing perfusion analysis. You often will not have an easy answer if you want to know what specific model was fit to the data, how image signal was converted to contrast concentration, or what were the values of the constants used in the analysis. Wait, you may not even know what are the units of the parametric map you see ... Wait, you may not even be able to export that pretty picture from the software you use, if you want to compare it pixel by pixel with the result obtained using another software on the same data ...

OSIPI believes that our ability to interoperate between perfusion analysis tools is fundamental to enable their evaluation and improvement. A precondition to enabling such interoperability is the set of guidelines defining transparent, detailed and standardized reporting of the perfusion analysis results.

We are working on developing a public document summarizing what attributes should accompany perfusion analysis results, how they should be named, what should be the units, how can those attributes be encoded and communicated between the various analysis, visualization and analytics tools.

**Stay tuned - coming up!**
