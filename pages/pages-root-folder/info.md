The mission of OSIPI is _To promote the sharing of perfusion imaging software in order to eliminate the practice of duplicate development, improve the reproducibility of perfusion imaging research, and speed up the translation into tools for discovery science, drug development, and clinical practice_.

OSIPI is a community-driven effort and is currently bootstrapped by the energetic group of volunteers. The Executive Management Board (EMB) is here to help faciliate this initiative:

* **Laura Bell**, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA (ISMRM liaison)
* **Amedeo Chiribiri**, King’s College London, UK
* **Patricia Clement**, Ghent University, Belgium
* **Charlotte Debus**, German Aerospace Center, Cologne, Germany (chair)
* [**Andrey Fedorov**](http://fedorov.github.io/), Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA (co-chair)
* **Simon Lévy**, CRMBM, Faculty of Medicine, Aix-Marseille University, France
* [**Steven Sourbron**](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/medicine/staff/782/dr-steven-sourbron/), University of Leeds, UK (ISMRM Perfusion study group liaison)
* [**Frank Zöllner**](https://www.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/inst/cbtm/ckm/mitarbeiter/personalpage/fzoellne.html), Heidelberg University, Germany

We welcome your feedback about the directions of the OSIPI activities! Feel free to reach out to individual EMB members, or contribute your feedback by posting to the [OSIPI forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-source-initiative-for-perfusion-imaging).
