OSIPI will establish an open-source, transparent, well-documented, version-controlled, validated, interoperable and dynamic library of core functionality for processing MRI perfusion data. The aim is to reduce duplicate development and optimize efforts, remove differences between implementations that may affect the comparability of results, and increase the transparency and reproducibility of our research.
