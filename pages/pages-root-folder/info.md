#subheadline: "... because we need one!"

The mission of OSIPI is _To promote the sharing of perfusion imaging software in order to eliminate the practice of duplicate development, improve the reproducibility of perfusion imaging research, and speed up the translation into tools for discovery science, drug development and clinical practice_.

OSIPI will establish an open-source, transparent, well-documented, version-controlled, validated, interoperable and dynamic library of core functionality for processing MRI perfusion data. The aim is to reduce duplicate development and optimize efforts, remove differences between implementations that may affect the comparability of results, and increase the transparency and reproducibility of our research.

OSIPI is being boot-strapped by the energetic group of volunteers comprising the OSIPI Executive Management Board:
* **Charlotte Debus**, German Aerospace Center, Cologne, Germany (chair)
* **Andrey Fedorov**, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA (co-chair)
* **Amedeo Chiribiri**, King’s College London, UK
* **Patricia Clement**, Ghent University, Belgium
* **Kyrre Emblem**, Oslo University Hospital, Norway
* **Michael Ingrisch**, Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich, Germany
* **Simon Lévy**, CRMBM, Faculty of Medicine, Aix-Marseille University, France.
* **Frank Zoellner**, University of Heidelberg, Germany
* **Laura Bell**, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA (ISMRM liaison)
* **Steven Sourbron**, University of Leeds, UK (ISMRM Perfusion study group liaison)
