Task forces are the OSIPI means to implement the [aims](/aims/).

A *task force* is a group of OSIPI community volunteers with the interest and expertise in the subject matter of a specific aim, who are actively working on a specific task towards achieving this aim. They are open for participation by anyone in the OSIPI community. 

Proposal for task forces can arise from members of the community. A single aim can have multiple task-forces, depending on the number of tasks that are required to implement the aim. Each task force is assigned one or more leads that direct activities of the task force and report to the EMB about the progress at the intervals mutually agreed between the task force and the EMB. Members of the community can join existing task forces at any time, but this needs to be agreed on with the existing members of the task force.

Task forces define their own scope and milestones. These can be changed if necessary, but requires approval of the EMB, in order to avoid duplicated work, or work outside of the scope of the task-force or aim.
Once the task is achieved, the task force may be closed.
