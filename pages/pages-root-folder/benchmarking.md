There are a lot of open source and proprietary solutions for perfusion analysis. Comparing them, however, is far from trivial. Few studies exist evaluating several tools on the same datasets, different (if any) standards are applied while establishing their performance, while some are not accompanied by any publicly available evaluation.

OSIPI aims to understand and summarize the existing best practices applied for evaluating performance of perfusion tools, and make suggestions, as needed, for conducting such evaluations. We plan to utilize the publicly available datasets to evaluate performance of the open source perfusion analysis tools. We hope the results of this evaluation will contribute to help make more informed decisions while selecting open source perfusion analysis solutions.

The resulting guidelines can also be used by the developers of the proprietary solutions to establish performance of their products.

**Stay tuned - coming up!**
