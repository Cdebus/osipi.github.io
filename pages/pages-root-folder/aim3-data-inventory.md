**Aim Perfusion Data inventory: Develop an inventory of data for the evaluation of perfusion software** 

This is aimed at researchers looking for data to test their perfusion analysis methods, and at data owners who want to share data for secondary research. The inventory will provide a curated list of publicly available synthetic, phantom, preclinical and clinical perfusion datasets. Digital reference objects (DROs) and phantom data can serve as ground truth for perfusion analysis methods, and in-vivo data can be used to test algorithms in real-world conditions for robustness, reproducibility and practicality.
